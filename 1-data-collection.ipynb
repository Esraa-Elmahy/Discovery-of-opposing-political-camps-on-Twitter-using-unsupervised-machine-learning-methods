    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a fascinating and diverse topic of Artificial Intelligence. Here, we will utilise it to handle text-based twitter datasets and present a complete study of the dataset from the United Kingdom, United States of America and worldwide using scraping and text analysis. We used Selenium and tweepy for data collection by scraping, data cleaning, NLTK Classes and Methods, the BERT model for sentiment analysis, and unsupervised clustering for model building. We have done our best to cover most of the actions that should be taken while working on a text data collection, exploratory and analysis."
